Tell me about a website you visited using The Wayback Machine. What year was it from? How is the older version different from the new version in terms of its overall design?

A website I visited using the wayback machine was google homepage in 2008. The present day version is a way more cleaned up version of the 2008 one. There are no harsh lines and little to no text. The search box has also changed to a simplier design. 

Web browsers function by a request being sent over the network to a server. It responds with a selection of web content as a response. Your browser interprets the content and then displays the page.
The browser I currently use is google chrome. I use it to surf and develop.
