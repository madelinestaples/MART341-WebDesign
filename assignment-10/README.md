Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

-A universal selector is used to style every element on a page. You might choose this over the others when you want to style a website quickly all at once. A element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type. This would be useful when wanting to style a group of the same kind of elements within one website. A class selector can be used to style and select html elements with the class attribute. This would be useful when selecting elements that serve the same function. The ID selector allows developers to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID. This would be useful for styling specific elements with an ID.
