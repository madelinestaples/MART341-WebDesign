Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

-Learning HTML felt really simple. It felt simple because I had taken creative coding I and II previously. I feel like this class had taught it in a more concise manner that made it easier for me to grasp. Separating HTML and CSS into two sections helped me learn better. I however did have some difficulties with putting videos on sites and learning about the "live site" versus the site that you have built out from your desktop. 

After we come back from spring break we will start to dive into CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

-I am very excited to take my web design skills further with this next section. I am a little anxious of the difficulties that could come up, however I am aware of the great resources I have through the class.
