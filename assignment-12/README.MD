What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?

Padding is used to create space around an elements content, inside of any defined borders.
Margin sets the margins or boundaries of an element and has up to four values that need to be defined. 
Borders are similar to margins in that they enclose an element and can have up to four values that need to be defined. However, borders can also be used for styling. 



Optional: how did this week's assignment go? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?

I felt like overall this weeks assignment went well. However, I did have some difficulties with styling my header. I had some trouble with the colors beign exactly how I wanted them to be, so it definetly took some trial and error.
