describe the difference between semantic and structural markup.

Semantic markup is used to reinforce the meaning of the information within a document. It might be used to place emphasis on a word or to provide citations and quotations.

Structural markup embeds information about the structure of a document. This includes things such as headings, paragraphs, breaks and lists.
